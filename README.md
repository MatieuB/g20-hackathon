Bud:
1. I though the it would be easy to start the database and just create tables and use them together. its not.

2. I though it would be hard to work in the team of 3, but I think we did a great job working together.

3. I think its important to decided what subject each person is working on, but also to be open to change.
it was hard in the begging to let go of code that I wrote, but ended up being a good thing.
It was very useful that one person in typing code and another one is looking at other pieces of code or googling things. and it was great talking about your line of thinking with someone who is working on the same thing as you are.

4. I learned how to create leftJoin, and how to work with github- pushing and pulling all the time.

5. I think I was good with the database issues, and keeping everyone up to date with github.

6. cookies!

7. The project scope didn't really change. we just changed our MVP, to really MVP..
